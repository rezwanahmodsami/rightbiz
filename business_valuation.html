          <h2>How to Value a Business</h2>
          <p class="faq-intro">Our most frequently asked question - “How do I value my business?”
          </p>
          <p>There are many business valuation methods you can use to find out how much a company is worth. Most
            commonly, you would value a business based on its turnover or net profit. Valuing a company based on net
            profit also involves you adjusting your figures by adding back any exceptional costs that the business has
            incurred. You would then use a market multiple and take into account any assets and liabilities to calculate
            the business’s worth Working out the value of a business can be a complicated process, and getting an
            accurate company valuation is key to balancing maximum value versus a quick business sale. When you want to
            value a business for sale, you should speak with Intelligent, the professionals, to make sure you’re getting
            the best possible price for your business. Ready to value your business for sale? Use the valuation tool

          <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
          <p class="discliamer-desc">Your enquiry will be sent to Business Transfer Agents near your business location.
            They will then contact
            you to arrange a convenient time to visit and value your business. If you decide to sell your business,
            marketing it at the right price is crucial. Advertising your business for sale at a price too high will mean
            it will be harder to sell or if you price it too low, you will be losing out. Getting a valuation from a
            Business Transfer Agent, will give you a very good idea of how much your business is worth and should help
            inform your decision on whether to sell your business now or wait. The business valuation service is free,
            but if you decide to sell, there will be some costs involved if you instruct a commercial agent to sell your
            business. This could be in the form of a commission or upfront fee, as long as you have this information,
            you can make the right choice for your own circumstance.
